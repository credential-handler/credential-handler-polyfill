## Background

## Install

#### Including `credential-handler-api` in browser scripts

Adding the following `<script>` makes the `navigator.credentialsPolyfill` object
available to your code.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/credential-handler-polyfill@1.0.4/dist/credential-handler-polyfill.min.js"></script>
```

#### Installing using Node.js (for development)

To install as a dependency of another project, add this to your `package.json`:

```
"credential-handler-polyfill": "^1.0.0"
```

If you plan to develop or modify this polyfill, install it from Github:

```
git clone https://github.com/digitalbazaar/credential-handler-polyfill.git
cd credential-handler-polyfill
npm install
```

## Usage

## Security

This polyfill makes use of a UI that emulates secure browser UI (also known as 
"browser chrome"). This polyfill UI is an emulation and IS NOT implemented by 
the browser. Support for the 
[Credential Handler API](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/) 
could make this UI (or most likely a much better one!) a reality in browsers in 
the future.
